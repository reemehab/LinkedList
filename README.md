# LinkedList
implementing a LinkedList Class using c++ , then merg Sort 2 lists without keeping duplicates.

n this code, I developed a linked list class similar to that provided in the C++ STL.
The public interface of my class provides basic insertion and deletion functions. In
addition, it provides an iterator class as an inner class in order to access the data stored in
the list. For example, if we have a list of three elements, and want to access the second
element, we should declare an iterator and initialize it to the position of the first element, and
move to the second position .
